    create_population()

Create and initialize a population of individuals for a genetic algorithm.

  This function creates a `Population` object, which is a collection of `Individual` objects.
  Each `Individual` represents a possible solution in the search space.
  The population is initialized with a predefined list of `initial_individuals`.

  The fitness of each `Individual` is calculated as the mean squared error (MSE) between the outputs
  of the individual's function and the target function `f`, evaluated over a set of `samples`.

  Upon initialization, the function prints out the details of the population, the average fitness,
  and the standard deviation of fitness values in the population.

# Returns
  - A `Population` object representing the initial population for the genetic algorithm.
