\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
    The field of \textit{evolutionary computation} (EC) is rich with diverse methodologies and algorithms, each 
    proving effective for complex optimization challenges. However, applying these techniques in practice often 
    involves repetitive coding and lacks a straightforward, user-friendly interface. To tackle these issues, this 
    chapter presents \emph{Keen}, a versatile genetic algorithms framework created in \textit{Kotlin}.

    Keen aims to make evolutionary algorithms more accessible and user-friendly. It primarily focuses on streamlining 
    the implementation of \textit{genetic algorithms} (GAs) and \textit{genetic programming} (GP), while also 
    providing a foundation for extending to other evolutionary algorithms. This approach is intended to encourage
    experimentation and innovation in the EC field, facilitating the development of novel algorithms and techniques.

    This chapter delves into the \textit{Keen framework}, detailing its structure, key components, and 
    functionalities. It covers the range of genetic operators in Keen, including selection, mutation, and crossover 
    methods. The chapter also explores GAs and GP techniques within Keen, highlighting their unique features and 
    potential applications.

    Additionally, the chapter explores how Keen is built for easy expansion and adaptation, encouraging innovation 
    and evolution in line with the EC field's growth. We hope that Keen will foster wider application of these 
    algorithms.
