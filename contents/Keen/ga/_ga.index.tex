\section{Genetic Algorithms}
\label{sec:genetic_algorithms}
  As we examine the framework in detail, it's essential to understand its key components. Although the general concepts of GAs are outlined in \vref{sec:bg:ga}, here we focus on their specific implementation and design within our framework. We'll look at three main areas: the structure of the \emph{genetic material}, the workings of the \emph{evolution engine}, and the function of the \emph{evolution listeners}. Each part will be explained in detail, showing how they work together to make the GAs effective for the framework's objectives.
