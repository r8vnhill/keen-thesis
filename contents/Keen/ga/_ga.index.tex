\section{Genetic Algorithms}
\label{sec:genetic_algorithms}
  As we delve deeper into the intricate workings of the framework, it becomes 
  imperative to explore its foundational components.
  While the theoretical underpinnings of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been 
  exhaustively discussed in \vref{sec:bg:ga}, this section aims to shed light 
  on the actual implementation and design specifics of the GAs within our 
  framework.
  Our exploration will be segmented into three primary components: the 
  representation and structuring of the \emph{genetic material}, the core 
  mechanics of the \emph{evolution engine}, and the crucial role of the 
  \emph{evolution listeners}.
  Each subsection will provide a granular understanding of how these elements 
  function and interconnect, ensuring that the GAs are optimally tailored to 
  meet the design goals of the framework.
