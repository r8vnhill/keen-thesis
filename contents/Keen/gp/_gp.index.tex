\section{Genetic Programming}
\label{sec:keen:gp}
    The basic concepts of Genetic Programming (GP) are detailed in \vref{sec:bg:gp}, but its implementation in the 
    \textit{Keen} framework provides a new perspective. This section highlights the initial implementation of GP in 
    Keen, focusing on its early development stage. As Keen evolves, GP is expected to become a key feature, enhancing 
    the connection between theoretical principles and practical advancements. Despite being in the early phases, Keen's 
    GP implementation already demonstrates the framework's flexibility and commitment to offering a complete set of 
    tools for evolutionary computation.
