\section{Genetic Programming}
\label{sec:keen:gp}
  While the principles of Genetic Programming (GP) have been extensively 
  discussed in \vref{sec:bg:gp}, its application within the \textit{Keen} 
  framework offers a unique perspective. This section sheds light on the 
  preliminary implementation of GP in the Keen framework, emphasizing its 
  prototypal nature. As the Keen framework continues its evolution, GP is 
  anticipated to be a focal component, promising a refined synergy between 
  theoretical foundations and innovative enhancements. Although it is still in 
  the early stages, the Keen framework's GP implementation showcases the 
  platform's adaptability and ambition to provide a comprehensive toolset for 
  evolutionary computation.
