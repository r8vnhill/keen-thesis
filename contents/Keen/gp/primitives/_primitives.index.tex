\subsection{Primitive Set}
\label{sec:keen:gp:primitives}
  The quintessential component of any GP implementation is the set of
  \textit{primitives} that define the language of the GP system. The
  \textit{Keen} framework's GP implementation is no exception, and its
  primitives are defined in the \texttt{prog} package.

  The \texttt{prog} package exposes three main components: \emph{reducible}
  expressions, \emph{program} trees, and \emph{generator} functions.
