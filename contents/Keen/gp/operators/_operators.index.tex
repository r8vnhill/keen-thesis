\subsection{Genetic Operators}
\label{sec:keen:gp:op}
  The preceding sections introduced genetic operators within the realm of genetic 
  algorithms. Yet, when we transition to Genetic Programming (GP), these operators 
  assume a different character. In GP, the evolutionary landscape is punctuated by 
  program trees or structures, making the operators' responsibilities more 
  multifaceted. They must not only bring about genetic variations but also uphold 
  the structural, syntactic, and semantic sanctity of the programs they modify.

  The forthcoming subsections shine a light on the bespoke genetic operators 
  devised for GP in the \textit{Keen} framework, elucidating their roles, 
  mechanisms, and significance.
