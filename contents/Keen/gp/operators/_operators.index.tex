\subsection{Genetic Operators}
\label{sec:keen:gp:op}
    The preceding sections introduced genetic operators within the realm of genetic 
    algorithms. Yet, when we transition to Genetic Programming (GP), these operators 
    assume a different character. In GP, the evolutionary landscape is punctuated by 
    program trees or structures, making the operators' responsibilities more 
    multifaceted. They must not only bring about genetic variations but also uphold 
    the structural, syntactic, and semantic sanctity of the programs they modify.

    The upcoming subsections focus on the unique genetic operators developed for GP in the \textit{Keen} framework, 
    explaining their functions, how they work, and their importance.

    \begin{remark}
        This operators are still in a prototypal stage, and their implementation
        is prone to change in future versions of the framework.
