\begin{definition}[Subtree Crossover]
    The \textit{subtree crossover} is a genetic operator designed for tree-structured chromosomes. For two given trees, 
    it randomly chooses a node or subtree in each. The subtrees anchored at these points are then interchanged, 
    birthing two new outputs. The operator can be mathematically expressed as:

    \begin{equation}
        X_{subtree}(P: \mathbb{P}, \rho_\mathbf{i}: [0,\, 1], \rho_\mathbf{c}: [0,\, 1], \rho_\mathbf{g}: [0,\, 1], e: \{0,\, 1\}) \to \mathbb{P}
    \end{equation}

    Here's a brief rundown of the parameters:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(P\): A population of program trees.
        \item \(\rho_\mathbf{i}\): Probability of an individual undergoing crossover.
        \item \(\rho_\mathbf{c}\): Chance of initiating the subtree crossover.
        \item \(\rho_\mathbf{g}\): Likelihood of selecting a gene for the crossover process.
        \item \(e\): A flag indicating if an individual can participate in crossover more than once.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    \textit{Keen}'s rendition of the subtree crossover currently equips all tree nodes with equal selection 
    probabilities. This strategy may evolve in subsequent versions to encompass a more sophisticated selection 
    mechanism.
\end{remark}

An extensive explanation of this operator was provided in \vref{sec:bg:gp:variation:mutation}.
