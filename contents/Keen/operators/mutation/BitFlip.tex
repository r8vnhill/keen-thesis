  \begin{definition}[Bit Flip Mutator]
    The \emph{bit flip mutator} is a mutation operator tailored for binary 
    genetic representations. It can be mathematically formulated as:

    \begin{equation}
      M_{0/1}(P: \mathbb{P},\, \mu: [0,\, 1],\, \rho_\mathbf{c}: [0,\, 1],\, \rho_g: [0,\, 1]) \to \mathbb{P}
    \end{equation}

    In this equation, \(P\) symbolizes the population, and \(\mu\) is the 
    predefined probability determining the likelihood of a given individual
    undergoing mutation, \(\rho_\mathbf{c}\) is the probability of a chromosome
    being selected for mutation, and \(\rho_g\) is the probability of a gene
    being selected for mutation.
  \end{definition}
