  \begin{definition}[Inversion Mutator]
  \label{def:keen:op:mut:inversion}
    The inversion mutator works by selecting a random subset of genes from a chromosome and subsequently inverting 
    their sequence. Formally, the operator can be represented as:

    \begin{equation}
      M_\mathrm{inv}(P: \mathbb{P},\, \mu: [0,\, 1],\, \rho_\mathbf{c}: [0,\, 1],\, \rho_{ib}: [0,\, 1]) \to \mathbb{P}
    \end{equation}

    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(P\) represents the population.
        \item \(\mu\) denotes the mutation probability.
        \item \(\rho_\mathbf{c}\) is the chromosome-wise mutation rate.
        \item \(\rho_{ib}\) is the \textit{inversion boundary} probability. 
          This probability is used to determine the starting and ending index 
          of the inversion.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{definition}
