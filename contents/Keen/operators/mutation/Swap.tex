  \begin{definition}[Swap Mutator]
  \label{def:keen:op:mut:swap}
    The \emph{swap mutator}, denoted by

    \begin{equation}
      M_\mathrm{swap}(P: \mathbb{P},\, \mu: [0,\, 1],\, \rho_\mathbf{c}: [0,\, 1],\, \rho_g: [0,\, 1]) \to \mathbb{P}
    \end{equation}

    is an operator that, with given probabilities, chooses a chromosome from a 
    population and swaps the positions of two genes within it. In the equation 
    above, \(P\) represents the population, \(\mu\) denotes the probability of 
    mutation, \(\rho_\mathbf{c}\) quantifies the likelihood of chromosome 
    selection, and \(\rho_g\) determines the gene selection probability.

    Its versatility lies in its applicability to any chromosome, regardless of 
    its specific genetic representation.
