  \begin{definition}[Tournament Selector]
  \label{def:keen:op:select:tournament}
    The \emph{tournament selector} uses a tournament selection method and is defined as:

    \begin{equation}
      \Sigma_\mathrm{tournament} :\: 
        \mathbb{P} \times \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{P};\;
      (P,\, n,\, k) \mapsto \Sigma_\mathrm{tournament}(P,\, n,\, k)
    \end{equation}

    In this definition, \(P\) is the population, \(n\) is the number of individuals to be selected, and \(k\) is the 
    size of each tournament.

    The selection process works as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Select a random group of \(k\) individuals from the population.
      \item Choose the individual with the highest fitness score from this group.
      \item Repeat steps 1 and 2 until \(n\) individuals have been selected.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  The selection dynamic is profoundly influenced by the tournament size, 
  \(k\).
  Opting for a larger \(k\) leans towards elitism, predominantly favoring 
  individuals with superior fitness scores.
  In contrast, a smaller \(k\) value promotes diversity, which helps prevent the genetic algorithm from converging too early.
\end{remark}
