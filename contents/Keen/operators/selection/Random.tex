\begin{definition}[Random Selector]
  \label{def:keen:operators:selection:random}
    The \emph{random selector} is characterized by its uniform approach, where every individual in the population is 
    assigned the same selection probability. Formally, the \texttt{RandomSelector} is articulated as:
    
    \begin{equation}
      \Sigma_{\mathrm{random}}(P: \mathbb{P}, n: \mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{P}
    \end{equation}
    
    Here, each individual is selected following a uniform probability distribution:
    
    \begin{equation}
      \rho_i = \frac{1}{|P|}
    \end{equation}
  \end{definition}
