  \caption{Performance of the \texttt{RandomSelector} class for the WGP for different word lengths. A single-point crossover with a crossover probability of 0.2 and a mutation probability of 0.06 was used. The population size was 500 and a limit of 1000 generations was used. The algorithm was run 3 times for each word length and the average performance is shown.}
