\begin{definition}[Random Selector]
  \begin{equation}
    \Sigma_{\mathrm{random}}(P: \mathbb{P},\, n: \mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{P}
  \end{equation}

  Each individual is then selected based on a uniform probability distribution:

  \begin{equation}
    \rho_i = \frac{1}{|P|}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

Although the \texttt{RandomSelector} is not frequently mentioned in literature, its straightforward nature provides a 
valuable touchstone for assessment.
