\section{Extensibility}
\label{sec:keen:extensibility}

    \textit{Keen} is architected with adaptability at its core, catering to a 
    wide array of genetic problems and computational scenarios. This adaptability 
    is principally achieved through the combination of intuitive interfaces and 
    the integration of the Factory Method Pattern.

    \subsection{Structured Extensibility Through Interfaces}
        \textit{Keen} employs well-defined interfaces to encapsulate essential 
        functionalities. These interfaces act as templates, enabling developers to 
        easily extend and modify the framework. The process is straightforward: to 
        enhance or customize capabilities, one simply implements the provided 
        interfaces.

    \subsection{Factory Method Pattern in Genetic Construction}
        The Factory Method Pattern plays a pivotal role in \textit{Keen}, 
        facilitating the dynamic creation of genetic material. By decoupling the 
        framework from specific implementations, this pattern provides the 
        flexibility to introduce varied genetic construction techniques seamlessly.

        Consider the \texttt{Chromosome.Factory} interface and the 
        \texttt{Chromosome.AbstractFactory} abstract class that extends it.These 
        provide a standardized mechanism for generating chromosome objects, ensuring
        easy adaptability to diverse and complex problem domains such as crash
        reproduction (refer to \vref{chap:beacon})

        For illustration, consider the \texttt{SimpleChromosome}:

        \begin{code}{
        Implementation of the \textit{SimpleChromosome} using the 
        \texttt{Chromosome.Factory} interface.
        }{label=lst:keen:factory}{kotlin}
        data class SimpleChromosome(override val genes: List<SimpleGene>) :
            Chromosome<Int, SimpleGene> {
            // ... Other implementations ...

            class Factory(override var size: Int, private val geneFactory: () -> SimpleGene) :
                Chromosome.AbstractFactory<Int, SimpleGene>() {
                override fun make() = SimpleChromosome((0 until size).map { geneFactory() })
            }
        }
        \end{code}

        Using the \texttt{SimpleChromosome} is straightforward:

        \begin{code}{
        Utilization of the \textit{SimpleChromosome} within an evolutionary 
        engine setup.
        }{label=lst:keen:factory:usage}{kotlin}
        data class SimpleGene(val dna: Int) : Gene<Int, SimpleGene> {
            // ... Implementation details for SimpleGene ...
        }
                
        fun main() {
            val engine = evolutionEngine(
                ::fitnessFn,
                genotypeOf {
                    chromosomeOf {
                        // Random genes between 0 and 100
                        SimpleChromosome.Factory(10) { SimpleGene((0..100).random()) }
                    }
                }
            ) {
                // ... Other configurations ...
            }
            val result = engine.evolve()
            // ... Use the result ...
        }
        \end{code}

    \subsection{Observer Pattern for Evolution Monitoring}
        A key design pattern employed in \textit{Keen} is the Observer Pattern. This
        pattern is fundamental for tracking the status of the evolutionary process.
        Its primary advantage lies in decoupling the core evolutionary engine from
        the monitoring components. This separation facilitates the extension and
        customization of monitoring functionalities without affecting the underlying
        evolutionary mechanisms.

        As discussed in \vref{sec:keen:ga:engine}, the \texttt{EvolutionListener}
        interface acts as a cornerstone for this pattern. It offers a standardized
        approach to observe and respond to the evolutionary process. Developers can
        implement this interface to devise custom listeners, which can then be
        seamlessly integrated with the evolutionary engine, enhancing the
        flexibility and adaptability of the monitoring process.

    \subsection{Modularity in Design}
        The architecture of \textit{Keen} is inherently modular, offering developers
        the flexibility to craft and integrate new algorithms with ease. This
        modularity is exemplified in the way genetic algorithms can be customized.
        Developers can, for instance, design a genetic algorithm that iteratively
        modifies the population until certain criteria are met, utilizing the
        existing functions that define the genetic algorithm's stages.

    This modular approach extends to the enhancement of evolutionary process
    notifications. For example, developers can augment the
    \texttt{EvolutionListener} to trigger alerts when the population achieves a
    predefined fitness level. This ability to modify and extend the notification
    system underscores the framework's versatility in adapting to varied
    evolutionary scenarios.

  \subsection{Sustaining Future Evolution}
    Designed with a forward-looking perspective, \textit{Keen} leverages 
    interfaces and the Factory Method Pattern to ensure its sustained 
    evolution. This positions \textit{Keen} advantageously, ensuring it remains 
    relevant and adaptable to emerging challenges in genetic algorithms and 
    computations.
