\begin{abstract}
    This thesis delves into Evolutionary Computation (EC), a niche in Artificial Intelligence, with a concentrated focus 
    on its applications in software engineering and scientific computing. It presents a pioneering Kotlin-based EC 
    framework, distinguished by its flexibility and ability to seamlessly incorporate various EC algorithms. This 
    adaptability ensures the framework's continued relevance and growth within the dynamic landscape of EC. The 
    framework's practical utility is demonstrated through case studies using Genetic Algorithms and Linear Genetic 
    Programming, highlighting its proficiency in tackling complex computational challenges.

    An extensive review of existing EC frameworks forms the cornerstone of this development, involving a detailed
    analysis of their key features and capabilities. This comprehensive evaluation played a crucial role in guiding the 
    design and evolution of the Kotlin-based EC framework.

    Additionally, the thesis emphasizes the theoretical foundations of EC, dedicating significant effort to thoroughly 
    examine its core principles and methodologies. This rigorous exploration not only enriches the understanding of EC 
    but also makes a substantial contribution to academic discourse, laying a solid groundwork for future research and 
    practical implementations in this field.
