\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
  The birth of artificial intelligence (AI) as we understand it today can be
  traced back to the mid-20th century, when Alan Turing posed the provocative
  question: \enquote{Can machines
  think?}~\autocite{turingCOMPUTINGMACHINERYINTELLIGENCE1950a}.
  From that moment on, the field has grown dramatically, developing an
  extensive range of applications that continue to expand and evolve.

  One of the early attempts to simulate evolution artificially dates back to
  1954 when Nills Aall
  Barricelli~\autocite{barricelliNumericalTestingEvolution1962} defined
  evolution as a purely statistical process.
  This pioneering work laid the foundations for the field of
  \emph{evolutionary computation} (EC), setting the criteria for a system to
  be deemed evolutionary.
  Barricelli posited that such a system's components must be capable of
  reproduction and mutation, enabling evolution via natural selection or
  survival of the fittest.

  Furthering these principles, John Holland's seminal work, \emph{Adaptation
  in Natural and Artificial
  Systems}~\autocite{hollandAdaptationNaturalArtificial1992a}, introduced
  \emph{genetic algorithms} (GA), a revolutionary approach to solving
  optimization problems inspired by the mechanisms of natural selection and
  genetics.
  This established the foundation for the field of \emph{evolutionary
  algorithms} (EA), spurring the development of numerous techniques and
  algorithms, including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and
  evolutionary strategies.

  Despite the demonstrated success of evolutionary algorithms in solving
  complex optimization problems, from scheduling and data mining to machine
  learning and beyond, their implementation can be cumbersome, often requiring
  a significant amount of repetitive coding.
  As AI adoption continues to grow, so does the need for streamlined,
  user-friendly libraries and frameworks that enable efficient experimentation
  and implementation of these powerful algorithms.

  One promising platform for the development of such a framework is the
  \emph{Kotlin programming language}~\autocite{KotlinProgrammingLanguagea}.
  \textit{Kotlin} boasts an intuitive syntax, static typing, and seamless
  interoperability with
  \textit{Java}~\autocite{CallingJavaKotlin,CallingKotlinJava,KotlinJavaInteropGuide},
  making it a compelling choice for AI and EC practitioners.
  The language's stature has been recognized officially in Android app
  development~\autocite{AndroidKotlinfirstApproach}, and it enjoys growing
  popularity among developers, with over 60\% of Android developers now using
  it~\autocite{LatestProgrammingLanguages2023}.
  Additionally, Kotlin is ranked as the ninth fastest-growing language
  globally from 2021 to 2023, according to a study by
  GitHub~\autocite{TopProgrammingLanguages}, surpassing Python by 0.4\%.

  The Kotlin Multiplatform feature further enhances the language's appeal by
  enabling code sharing across a multitude of platforms, including JVM,
  JavaScript, Android, iOS, and native desktop applications.
  This capability fosters increased productivity and consistency in
  development work.

  Given these strengths, the main goal of this thesis is to leverage
  \textit{Kotlin} to design and implement a novel genetic algorithms
  framework, contributing to the ever-expanding usage of \textit{Kotlin} in
  the AI community.
  We anticipate that this framework will expedite research and applications in
  the field, accelerating the
