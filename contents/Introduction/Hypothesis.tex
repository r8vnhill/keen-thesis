\section{Hypothesis and Research Questions}
\label{sec:hyphotesis_and_research_questions}
  \subsection{Hypothesis}
    The \textit{Kotlin} programming language, known for its expressive syntax, 
    simplicity, and cross-platform capabilities, presents an opportunity for 
    enhancing the field of evolutionary algorithms.
    We hypothesize that the development of an efficient and user-friendly
    genetic algorithms framework in \textit{Kotlin} could significantly
    streamline the implementation process of these algorithms, thereby
    catalyzing innovation and expediting research in this domain.

  \subsection{Research Questions}
    To assess the validity of our hypothesis and further investigate the
    potential benefits of the proposed \textit{Kotlin}-based framework, we
    outline the following pivotal research questions:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What constitute the \textit{fundamental requirements} for a
        versatile, efficient, and user-friendly genetic algorithm framework?
      \item How can the \textit{unique language features} of \textit{Kotlin} be
        leveraged to fulfill these requirements and facilitate the development
        and use of genetic algorithms?
      \item How does the performance and \textit{ease of use} of a
        \textit{Kotlin}-based genetic algorithms framework compare to that of
        existing solutions, particularly in terms of syntactical complexity?
      \item In what ways can the proposed \textit{Kotlin}-based framework be
        applied to \textit{address complex real-world problems}, thereby
        demonstrating its practical viability and potential to contribute to
        advancements in AI and evolutionary computation?
      \item What potential opportunities exist for the \textit{enhancement and
        expansion} of the proposed \textit{Kotlin}-based genetic algorithm
        framework in the future?
    \end{enumerate}
    
    These research questions serve as guideposts for our exploration into the
    feasibility and potential impact of using \textit{Kotlin} to develop a novel
    genetic algorithms framework.
    Each question targets a specific facet of the project, offering a holistic
    understanding of the technical intricacies, practical applications, and
    future prospects of our proposed framework.
