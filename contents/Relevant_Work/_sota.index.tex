\chapter{Relevant Work (State of the Art)}
\label{chap:sota}

  In this chapter, we will explore the current state of the art in the field of
  genetic algorithm frameworks.
  While the theory of genetic algorithms is not a recent development, the
  application of these algorithms continues to evolve\footnote{No pun intended.}
  with the advancement of various programming languages and tools.
  Therefore, our focus in this chapter will be on current and actively developed
  frameworks widely used for studying and implementing genetic algorithms.

  Specifically, we will look into Agile Artificial Intelligence in Pharo, DEAP,
  Jenetics, ECJ, and GeneticSharp.
  Each section will provide a brief overview of the framework along with basic
  code samples to highlight their syntax and outline their unique features and
  differences.
  We believe this approach will provide a comprehensive perspective on the
  versatility and diversity of tools available in this field.

  This state-of-the-art review does not only offer insights into the current
  trends and tools in genetic algorithms but also sets the stage for our
  contribution - a genetic algorithm framework in Kotlin.
