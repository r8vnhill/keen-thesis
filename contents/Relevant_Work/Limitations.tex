\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:sota:limitations}
  While recognizing the dynamic evolution and valuable community contributions of the frameworks reviewed, this study has identified key limitations that could be addressed to enhance their utility and user-friendliness:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Syntactic Complexity: Some frameworks exhibit a high degree of syntactic verbosity, potentially complicating their adoption by newcomers and increasing the learning curve.
    \item Flexibility in Customization: There appears to be a constrained flexibility in implementing custom operators and strategies, particularly in evolutionary algorithms that require a variable number of parents or offspring, which may limit their applicability to more complex or unconventional problems.
    \item Validation Tools: Robust algorithm implementation demands extensive validations to ensure result accuracy. The current lack of comprehensive validation tools within these frameworks can hinder this process, making it more cumbersome to guarantee the correctness of outcomes.
  \end{enumerate}

  Addressing these limitations could significantly enhance the frameworks' effectiveness and broaden their applicability in the field of evolutionary computation.

  As a minor note, none of the frameworks reviewed provides native support for Kotlin, which could be a potential area for future exploration and development.
