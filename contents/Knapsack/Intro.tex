\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:knapsack:intro}
  The knapsack problem stands as a classic optimization dilemma, posing the task 
  of determining the optimal combination of items with given weights and values 
  while adhering to a weight constraint.
  Its practical relevance spans diverse fields, making it an essential study in 
  the realm of optimization.

  This chapter delves into the two prominent variants of the knapsack problem: 
  the \emph{unbounded} and the \emph{0-1} knapsack.
  The former allows an infinite number of each item, whereas the latter 
  restricts each item to a singular instance.
  Both versions are analyzed in depth, elucidating their inherent complexities 
  and solutions.
