\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:fn_opt:conclusion}

    In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis conducted in this section offers insightful revelations into the 
    performance dynamics of different selection strategies within the \textit{Keen} framework. The Tournament Selector 
    emerges as a notably efficient strategy, particularly in maintaining optimal solutions and achieving the lowest 
    average error across various functions. Its proficiency in dealing with a spectrum of optimization challenges 
    underscores its adaptability and robustness. Conversely, the Random and Roulette Selectors, while occasionally 
    attaining the global optimum, demonstrate limitations in sustaining optimal solutions over extended periods. 
    This observation suggests the suitability of a target fitness criterion for these selectors, contrary to the 
    stagnation termination criterion effective for the Tournament Selector. The consistent selection times and 
    evolutionary outcomes observed across all selectors reflect the underlying stability of the \textit{Keen} framework. 
    However, the variable performance in dealing with functions characterized by multiple local optima highlights the 
    importance of selector choice, tailored to the specific nature of the optimization problem at hand. Overall, these 
    findings contribute significantly to understanding the strengths and limitations of various selection strategies 
    in genetic algorithm optimization, providing valuable guidance for their application in diverse computational 
    contexts.
