\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:fn_opt:intro}
  Real function optimization is crucial across various disciplines, such as data science, machine learning, operations research, and engineering, where Genetic Algorithms (GAs) often come into play.

  This chapter showcases \textit{Keen}'s application in solving classical optimization challenges detailed in \vref{app:test_functions}. The focus here is not on problem formulation but on demonstrating \textit{Keen}'s utility as a solution tool. For an in-depth look at \textit{Keen}'s architecture and features, see \vref{chap:keen}.

  We will present problem overviews, \textit{Keen}-based solutions, results, and analyses, highlighting \textit{Keen}'s effectiveness and adaptability in solving diverse optimization tasks.
