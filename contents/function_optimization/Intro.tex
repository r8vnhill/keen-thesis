\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:fn_opt:intro}
  Real function optimization is a prevalent task in numerous fields, from 
  \textit{data science} and \textit{machine learning} (ML) to 
  \textit{operations research} and \textit{engineering}.
  It presents a common class of challenges that can be effectively addressed
  using GAs.

  This chapter embarks on a practical exploration of \textit{Keen}.
  We aim to illustrate the robust capabilities of \textit{Keen} by employing
  it to solve various classic optimization problems, the details of which are
  provided in \vref{app:test_functions}.

  Please note that this chapter doesn't intend to delve into the formulation
  of these optimization problems; the discussion is primarily centered around
  how \textit{Keen} can be leveraged as a solution tool.
  For a comprehensive understanding of \textit{Keen}, its design, and its
  features, refer to \vref{chap:keen}.
  
  The ensuing sections will navigate through the problem descriptions, the
  solutions employed using \textit{Keen}, the corresponding results, and the
  consequent analysis.
  In the following sections, we will systematically explore and demonstrate
  the efficiency and versatility of \textit{Keen} in tackling a range of
  optimization problems.
