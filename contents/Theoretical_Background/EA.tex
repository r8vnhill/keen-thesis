\section{Evolutionary Algorithms}
\label{sec:evolutionary_algorithms}
  In the field of computational intelligence, evolutionary algorithms (EA) 
  \autocite{yuIntroductionEvolutionaryAlgorithms2010} are a family of algorithms inspired by the 
  process of natural selection.
  They are part of the larger field of evolutionary 
  computation,\footnote{See definition \ref{def:evolutionary_computation}} which is a subfield of 
  metaheuristics.\footnote{See definition \ref{def:metaheuristic}}

  EAs are algorithms that perform optimization or learning tasks by evolving solutions to a given
  problem. These tasks may range from function optimization to machine learning or game AI development.
  EAs have three main characteristics:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Population-based:} These algorithms work with a population of solutions, allowing
      them to explore the search space in parallel.\footnote{
        Not to be confused with parallelization, which is a technique used to speed up the execution
        of an algorithm by running it in parallel on multiple processors.
        \enquote{Parallel} in this context means that the algorithm is exploring multiple points in
        the search space (Def. \ref{def:search_space}) simultaneously.
      }
    \item \textbf{Fitness-oriented:} The solutions in the population are evaluated using a fitness
      function, which is a problem-dependent function that assigns a value to each solution based on its quality.
      The goal of the algorithm is to find the solution with the highest\footnote{
        In some cases, the goal is to minimize the fitness function, in which case the algorithm
        will aim to find the solution with the lowest fitness.
      } fitness.
    \item \textbf{Variation-driven:} The candidate solutions are modified using genetic operators,
      such as mutation, crossover, and selection, to create new solutions.
      These operators are usually based on the biological processes of mutation and recombination.
  \end{itemize}
  
  While these principles serve as the foundation for most EAs, it's important to note that some 
  variants may prioritize some principles over others, or introduce new principles. 
  This diversity allows EAs to be adapted to a wide range of problems and scenarios.
