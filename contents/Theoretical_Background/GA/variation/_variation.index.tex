\subsection{Variation}
\label{sec:genetic_algorithms:variation}
  Variation is the process of creating new individuals from existing ones.
  In a GA, variation is achieved by applying \emph{genetic operators} to the individuals in the
  population.
  The most common genetic operators are \emph{crossover} and \emph{mutation}.
  In this section, we will explore these operators and their role in the GA.
