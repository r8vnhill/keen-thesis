\subsection{Fitness function}

  \begin{definition}[Fitness function]
  \label{def:fitness_function}
    A \emph{fitness function} is a function \(f: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\), where \(S\) is the
    search space and \(n\) is the number of objectives of the optimization problem, that takes a
    genotype as input and returns a vector of real numbers representing how close the individual 
    is to the global optimum of each objective.

    The fitness function is usually defined by the user of the algorithm, and it is problem
    dependent.
  \end{definition}

  The one max problem is a maximization problem with a single objective, so the fitness function
  would be defined as follows:

  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fitness_function:one_max}
    f(\mathbf{G}) = \sum_{i=1}^n g_i
  \end{equation}
