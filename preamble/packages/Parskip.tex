% | parskip - Package to adjust paragraph formatting.
% |
% | The parskip package adjusts the formatting of paragraphs in a LaTeX document.
% | In particular, it changes the default settings to remove the indentation at the beginning of a 
% | paragraph and add extra vertical space (a "skip") between paragraphs.
% |
% | The package is loaded in the preamble of the document with the command \usepackage{parskip}.
% |
% | This package helps in creating documents where paragraphs are separated by a blank line and 
% | there is no indentation at the start of paragraphs.
% | These settings are common in certain styles of documents, such as business letters or 
% | post-modernist texts.
% |
% | While the package is quite useful, it should be used with caution as it overrides some LaTeX 
% | defaults related to spacing. 
% | Particularly, it can cause problems with other packages or document classes that heavily 
% | customize the appearance of paragraphs.
% | Always test your document layout with and without the parskip package to ensure it doesn't 
% | interfere with other design elements.
