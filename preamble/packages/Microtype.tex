% | microtype - Provides improvements in LaTeX text justification
% |
% | The microtype package is used in LaTeX to improve the appearance and 
% | readability of a document.
% | It makes subtle adjustments to the justification of text, providing 
% | aesthetically pleasing results.
% |
% | Main features include:
% | 1. Protrusion: Adjusts the positioning of characters at the margins of a 
% |    text, often referred to as 'margin kerning' or 'character protrusion'.
% | 2. Expansion: Slightly alters the widths of characters to better fit a line 
% |    ('font expansion').
% | 3. Tracking: Adjusts the space between letters for specific fonts, which is 
% |    beneficial for small caps or bold fonts.
% |
% | By including the line \usepackage{microtype} in the preamble of your LaTeX 
% | document, you can take advantage of these features automatically. Further 
% | customization is possible through various options and commands provided by 
% | the package.
