% | minted (with the chapter and newfloat options) - Syntax highlighting for code 
% | snippets in the document
% |
% | The minted package provides advanced features for syntax highlighting in LaTeX
% | documents. It uses Pygments, a Python-based syntax highlighter, which provides 
% | support for a wide range of programming and markup languages. The minted package 
% | provides a flexible and customizable interface for including source code in a 
% | document. 
% |
% | The 'chapter' option places the listing number before the figure or table number. 
% | For instance, Listing 2.3 will be the third listing in the second chapter. This 
% | option improves the organization of documents, especially those with a large 
% | number of code snippets.
% |
% | The 'newfloat' option is used to define a new floating environment for code 
% | listings. This allows listings to be included in documents in a way similar to 
% | figures and tables.
% |
% | Note: The minted package requires the '--shell-escape' flag to be enabled 
% | during the LaTeX compilation process because it interfaces with Pygments 
% | (a Python library) externally.
