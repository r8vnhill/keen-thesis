% | xcolor - Colour support for LaTeX documents
% | 
% | The 'xcolor' package provides easy driver-independent access to several 
% | kinds of colour tints, shades, tones, and mixes of arbitrary colours.
% | It allows a user to select a document-wide target colour model and offers 
% | complete tools for conversion between nine different colour models. 
% | Furthermore, there is a command \providecolor for colour galleys.
% | 
% | The 'table' option loads the colortbl package, which allows you to add 
% | colour to LaTeX tables. 
% | With this option, the user can control row colors, column colors, cell 
% | colors, etc.
% | 
% | In this case, it is used to colour cells, rows, and columns in tables, which
% | is beneficial for highlighting specific parts of the tables.
% |
% | Usage:
% | \usepackage[table]{xcolor}
% |
% | #1 - [table]: Optional argument used to load the 'colortbl' package.
\usepackage[table]{xcolor}
