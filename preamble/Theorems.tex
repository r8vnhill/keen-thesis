% | newtheorem - Defines new theorem-like environments
% | newtheorem* - Defines unnumbered theorem-like environments
% |
% | The 'newtheorem' and 'newtheorem*' commands in LaTeX are used to define new
% | theorem-like environments such as remarks, definitions, propositions, lemmas, 
% | theorems, and so on. 
% |
% | The 'newtheorem' command produces a numbered environment that is automatically
% | numbered within the specified parent counter. In this case, 'definition' is 
% | numbered within 'chapter'.
% |
% | The 'newtheorem*' command produces an unnumbered environment. In this case, 
% | 'remark' is unnumbered.
% |
% | Parameters for newtheorem:
% | {environment name} - The name of the new environment (in this case, 
% |                      'definition').
% | [parent counter] - Optional argument specifying the counter within which the 
% |                    new environment should be numbered (in this case, 
% |                    'chapter').
% |
% | Parameters for newtheorem*:
% | {environment name} - The name of the new environment (in this case, 
% |                      'remark').
