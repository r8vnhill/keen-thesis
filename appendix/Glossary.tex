\chapter{Glossary}
\label{appendix:glossary}
  In this appendix we present a glossary of terms used throughout this document that may not be
  familiar to the reader, but are not explained in the main text due to their common use in the
  field.

  \section*{E}
    \begin{definition}[Evolutionary computation]
    \label{def:evolutionary_computation}
      Family of algorithms for global optimization inspired by the process of natural selection.

      This typically involves processes mimicking natural selection, mutation, recombination, and 
      survival of the fittest. 
      The solutions to a problem are encoded as a set of \enquote{individuals} in a 
      \enquote{population}. 
      Over multiple generations, these individuals are selected and modified (via genetic operators 
      like crossover and mutation) in order to find better solutions.
    \end{definition}

  \section*{M}
    \begin{definition}[Metaheuristics]
    \label{def:metaheuristic}
      Problem-independent algorithmic method that yields a sufficiently good solution within 
      reasonable time for an optimization problem, especially for complex problems where an exact 
      solution is not crucial.
    \end{definition}
