  \begin{definition}[Metaheuristics]
  \label{def:metaheuristic}
    Problem-independent algorithmic method that yields a sufficiently good solution within 
    reasonable time for an optimization problem, especially for complex problems where an exact 
    solution is not crucial.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}[Multimodal function]
  \label{def:multimodal_function}
    A multimodal function is a function that has multiple local maxima and/or 
    multiple local minima within a given domain or interval.
    In other words, it has several peaks and troughs.
    The term "multi" in "multimodal" signifies the presence of multiple modes 
    or peaks in the function.

    Mathematically, if \(f\) is a multimodal function in an interval \([a,\, 
    b]\), then there exist multiple points \(c_1,\, c_2,\, \dots,\, c_n \) in 
    \([a,\, b]\) such that \(f\) has local maxima and/or minima at these points.
    
    Multimodal functions can be more challenging for optimization algorithms 
    because the presence of multiple local optima can trap optimization 
    techniques in suboptimal solutions, preventing them from finding the global 
    optimum.
    This complexity often necessitates more sophisticated or stochastic 
    optimization techniques, like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms, to 
    effectively explore the search space.
